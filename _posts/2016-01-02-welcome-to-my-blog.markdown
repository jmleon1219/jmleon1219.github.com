Welcome!  I started this blog to record my thoughts and observations on all things technology related.  I've been meaning to do this for some time but finally found the time and technology to adequately do the job.

## What technologies are used for rendering this site?

+	<em>Jekyll</em> - Jekyll uses 2 technologies to render your site.  The first, Liquid, is a ruby library and utilizes loops and variables to render a site without the risk of having arbitrary code executed on the server.  The second is markdown.  Markdown is a tool that allows users to write plain text and have it render to vaild HTML.
+	<em>Github</em> - This site is hosted by Github.  The code for this site is readily accessible by visiting my [Github account] (https://github.com/jmleon1219)
+	<em>My own domain</em> - Yes, after years of procrastination the domain with my name was still available!  


## Topics this site will cover
I've always wanted to make a site that focuses on answering questions that other people may have too.  I am anticipating that some topics will change to what exactly I am working on at the time.
